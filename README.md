About
------
The system was developed for a user who wants to evaluate the heat in Celsius units in the center of a metal board according to various # variables: the type of metal, the thickness of the board, the initial temperatures and the desired time.

â€¢ The user will need to enter the following fields:
  o Initial temperature in the plate of the selected metal, randomly (by pressing the random button).
  o Select the metal type from the following metals: Aluminum, Copper, Iron, Silver.
  o Select the metal surface width in meters.
  o Temperature in Celsius from the inside of the metal surface.
  o Temperature in Celsius from the outside of the metal surface.
  o Time (in minutes) for the simulation for heat estimate in the center of the metal according to the data.
